# Space Invaders!

#### By Chris Martinez

## Description
_Space invaders! with canvas and JS. Though there are a few tutorials out there to make exactly this project, I am not using them. I won't even look at them, so i can claim this 100% mine (except for the sprite sheet). Until further notice this is a work in progress and may not be fully playable, but should at least be animated and semi functional for previewing.

## Known Bugs
_Do not use this in IE. Why are you using IE?

## Technologies Used

HTML5
CSS
Javascript
jQuery
some web tools i've found extremely useful in making these types of game:
http://getspritexy.com/ for getting sprite coordinates
http://www.bfxr.net/ for generating 8 bit sounds
https://www.freesound.org/ great sound library, where the fire sound comes from in my game
http://www.w3schools.com/graphics/game_intro.asp and pretty much where most of my knowlege of canvas games comes from at this point.
